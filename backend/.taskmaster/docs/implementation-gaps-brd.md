# Solana Volume Bot - Implementation Gaps & Completion BRD

## Document Purpose

This BRD identifies all missing implementations, incomplete features, and verification needs to complete the Solana Volume Bot platform based on the original PRD.md requirements. It covers both backend and frontend gaps, integration issues, and testing requirements.

## Executive Summary

The platform foundation is ~40% complete with core infrastructure in place:
- ✅ Database schema complete
- ✅ Authentication system working
- ✅ Basic API endpoints scaffolded
- ❌ Worker job handlers not implemented
- ❌ Frontend UI components mostly missing
- ❌ Real-time updates not implemented
- ❌ Admin features missing
- ❌ Testing coverage minimal

## Critical Missing Features

### 1. Backend Worker Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1.1 Queue Job Handlers
**Status**: Not implemented
**Impact**: Critical - campaigns cannot execute

**Required Workers**:
- `gather` queue worker: Fetch pool info, balances, pre-flight checks
- `trade.buy` queue worker: Execute buy transactions using legacy/jito executors
- `trade.sell` queue worker: Execute sell transactions using legacy/jito executors
- `distribute` queue worker: SOL distribution to generated wallets
- `status` queue worker: Periodic campaign metrics aggregation
- `webhook` queue worker: Deliver event payloads with retries
- `funds.gather` queue worker: Consolidate SOL from wallets back to main

**Implementation Needs**:
- Create worker classes for each queue in `backend/workers/src/workers/`
- Wire up legacy executor logic (jito.ts, legacy.ts) to job handlers
- Implement job retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add job idempotency checks (signature deduplication)
- Create job progress tracking and status updates to database
- Add error handling and dead-letter queue processing

#### 1.2 Campaign Execution Engine
**Status**: Partially implemented (API endpoints exist, no worker logic)
**Impact**: Critical

**Missing Logic**:
- Campaign start: Create campaign_run, generate/distribute to wallets, enqueue initial jobs
- Campaign pause: Stop job processing, maintain state
- Campaign resume: Restart from last state
- Campaign stop: Clean shutdown, gather funds, finalize run
- Distribute endpoint: Generate keypairs, distribute SOL, enqueue first trades
- Sell-only mode: Single pass sell for all wallet tokens
- Gather funds: Consolidate SOL from all active wallets

**Verification Needed**:
- Test campaign lifecycle: create → start → pause → resume → stop
- Verify jobs are correctly enqueued with proper payload structure
- Confirm idempotency works for replayed jobs
- Test RPC failover and retry mechanisms

### 2. Real-Time Updates (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 2.1 WebSocket/SSE Implementation
**Status**: Not implemented
**Impact**: High - users cannot see live campaign progress

**Requirements**:

- Channel per campaign_id for live updates
- Emit events: job_started, job_completed, job_failed, run_status_changed
- Authentication: Validate Supabase JWT on socket connection
- Frontend: Subscribe to campaign-specific channels
- Reconnection logic with state recovery

#### 2.2 Live Status Aggregation
**Status**: Not implemented

**Requirements**:

- Aggregate metrics: jobs succeeded/failed/pending, current volume, tx count
- Update campaign_runs.summary in database
- Broadcast updates via WebSocket to connected clients

### 3. Frontend UI Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 3.1 Dashboard Components

- Wallet list with balances and activity feed
- Token registration form with metadata preview
- Pool selection interface with discovery
- Settings forms (trading config, sell config, jito config)
- Execution logs table with filters and pagination
- Real-time status indicators and progress bars

**Implementation Needs**:
